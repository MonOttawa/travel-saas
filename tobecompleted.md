# Remaining Follow-up Tasks

- Backfill latitude/longitude for the remaining cities in `app/data/canadian-cities.json` so every autocomplete option supports automatic distance suggestions.
- Perform a full manual walkthrough of `/estimator` in MCP Chrome (all four wizard steps, CSV/PDF exports) now that the dev server is reachable again.
- Confirm a fresh scrape populates `app/data/official-rates/*.json` and captures exchange-rate window metadata before cutting the release bundle.
