# Remaining Follow-up Tasks

- Perform a full manual walkthrough of `/estimator` in MCP Chrome (all four wizard steps, CSV/PDF exports) now that the dev server is reachable again.
- Modify the estimator workflow to support international trips, including meal breakdown by breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
- Before implementing the international workflow, fix the Appendix D scraper (or source alternate data) so dinner, incidental, and total amounts are available in `international-allowances.json`.
- Capture flight details and costs within the transportation step to complement mileage/rental options.
- Add sharing functionality so users can send saved cost estimates to colleagues.
