Government travel planning is not just about picking flights and hotels. For most federal and provincial departments, every itinerary has to satisfy the National Joint Council (NJC) directives, kilometre allowances, accommodation rate caps, and internal approval workflows. The math is precise, but the process is manual—and that adds up to hours of repetitive work each month.

## The old playbook: spreadsheets and bookmarked PDFs

Before teams adopt our estimator, we usually see a familiar set of tools:

- A giant spreadsheet with tabs for per-diems, mileage, and accommodation caps.
- Bookmarked NJC and PWGSC pages for quick reference (and frantic re-checking when a directive changes).
- Email threads between coordinators, travellers, and finance to verify the totals.

It works, but it’s tedious. Coordinators enter inputs multiple times, approvers verify figures line by line, and finance almost always needs a “cleaner” version for the audit trail. Across a full month of travel planning, the hours spent on data entry and validation become a hidden cost.

## A month in the life: Amelia’s regional field audits

Meet Amelia, a regional program coordinator responsible for field audits across Ontario and Quebec. In peak season she supports 8–10 trips per month, each with at least two travellers. Here’s what her process used to look like:

1. **Collect details** via email—origin, destination, dates, purpose, travellers.
2. **Check policy rates** by digging through NJC per-diem tables and the PWGSC accommodation directory.
3. **Calculate totals** manually in Excel: meals, mileage, hotel caps, extras.
4. **Prepare an approval package** with a summary tab and attachments for finance.

Each itinerary took about 45 minutes end-to-end. Multiply that by 9 trips and Amelia was spending roughly seven hours a month just assembling cost estimates (and this doesn’t include the back-and-forth when someone spotted a typo).

## The new workflow with Travel Cost Estimator

Now the process fits inside our four-step wizard:

1. **Trip basics** – enter origin, destination, travel dates, and travellers.
2. **Transport & rates** – choose personal vs. rental vehicle; the tool auto-suggests mileage using official geodata and the latest kilometric allowances.
3. **Lodging & extras** – select hotel nights and per-diem extras while we enforce PWGSC caps and NJC rules.
4. **Review & export** – generate a polished PDF summary plus a CSV for finance.

Amelia spends less than 10 minutes per trip. She gets a print-ready PDF (with the policy references built in) and a CSV that finance can import straight into their approval system. Her monthly time sink is now under two hours—a savings of roughly five hours **every single month**.

## Where those hours go instead

- **Travelers get itineraries faster.** Approvals roll in sooner because approvers can see policy-compliant numbers immediately.
- **Finance stops reformatting.** The exports include the same breakdown they need for audit trails, so there’s less duplication downstream.
- **Coordinators can tackle higher-value work.** In Amelia’s case, she now spends the reclaimed hours on route optimization and policy updates rather than manual lookups.

## Why a subscription quickly pays for itself

Even our entry subscription tier costs less than a half-day of a coordinator’s time. When the tool saves five or more hours per month (as it did for Amelia), it becomes a straightforward decision: the subscription essentially pays for itself in the first week. After that, it’s pure operational headroom.

And the benefits compound. Teams avoid policy drift (thanks to automatic rate sync), share standardized exports with stakeholders, and build a repeatable process that can scale with the travel program.
